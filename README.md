The Texting Tree
================

A small Python application for controlling an internet-connected Christmas Tree. It receives an incoming SMS from Twilio, parses the color in the body of the message, and hits the Spark Core's API to deliver an RGB value. The Spark Core then changes the color of a strand of lights on a Christmas Tree.
